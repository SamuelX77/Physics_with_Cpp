Hello, everyone! Welcome to my Github page!

I may be new here, but that won't stop me from sharing what I'm learning.
This repository, therefore, marks the beginning of my journey, where I would be posting projects 
(no matter how small or big) to gather feedback from experts and collaborate on more
exciting projects.

As a Physics major who is also taking some C++ coursework, I would be updating this repo
with solutions to interesting equations I encounter. Well, apart from my reading materials
from school, I am also exploring The Programming Pricinples and Practices by Bjarne Stroustrup-Amazing read!
My studies currently cover the use of control-flow statements, for which you might expect to see 
a lot in my codes.

This is just the beginning, and there are more exciting stuff ahead: microcontrollers. 

Let's connect, share ideas and have fun while learning. Accelerate, Anon!

Hello, everyone! Welcome to my Github page!

This repository marks the beginning of my journey, where I would be posting projects 
(no matter how small or big) to gather feedback from experts and collaborate on more
exciting projects.

As a Physics major who is also taking some C++ coursework, I would be updating this repo
with solutions to interesting equations I encounter. Well, apart from my reading materials
from school, I am also exploring The Programming Pricinples and Practices by Bjarne Stroustrup - Amazing read!

This is just the beginning, and there are more exciting stuff ahead. 

Let's connect, share ideas and have fun while learning. Accelerate, Anon!
